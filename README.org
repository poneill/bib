* Overview
  This is my bibliography.  I am trying to take [[http://reproducibleresearch.net/index.php/Main_Page][reproducible research]]
  seriously.  For me, 'reproducible research' means that it should be
  possible for other workers to clone a repo for my project and
  [[http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/15/make-for-data-scientists/][literally compile my paper]] by typing:

: $ make

  at the command line.  By storing my bibliography as a git
  repository, I can [[http://andrius.velykis.lt/2012/06/master-bibtex-file-git-submodules/][include it as a submodule]] in project repositories
  and compile my paper as if it were any file belonging to the
  project.

* Acknowledgements
  Thanks to Paul Butler, Andrius Velykis, Eric Schulte and others for
  helpful writings on this subject.
