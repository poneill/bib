doi = {10.1073/pnas.0506610103}, 
abstract ={The control of gene expression involves complex mechanisms
                  that show large variation in design. For example,
                  genes can be turned on either by the binding of an
                  activator (positive control) or the unbinding of a
                  repressor (negative control). What determines the
                  choice of mode of control for each gene? This study
                  proposes rules for gene regulation based on the
                  assumption that free regulatory sites are exposed to
                  nonspecific binding errors, whereas sites bound to
                  their cognate regulators are protected from
                  errors. Hence, the selected mechanisms keep the
                  sites bound to their designated regulators for most
                  of the time, thus minimizing fitness-reducing
                  errors. This offers an explanation of the
                  empirically demonstrated Savageau demand rule: Genes
                  that are needed often in the natural environment
                  tend to be regulated by activators, and rarely
                  needed genes tend to be regulated by repressors; in
                  both cases, sites are bound for most of the time,
                  and errors are minimized. The fitness advantage of
                  error minimization appears to be readily
                  selectable. The present approach can also generate
                  rules for multi-regulator systems. The
                  error-minimization framework raises several
                  experimentally testable hypotheses. It may also
                  apply to other biological regulation systems, such
                  as those involving protein–protein interactions.},

In a living Escherichia coli cell, we directly observed specific binding of a lac repressor, labeled with a fluorescent protein, to a chromosomal lac operator. Using single-molecule detection techniques, we measured the kinetics of binding and dissociation of the repressor in response to metabolic signals. Furthermore, we characterized the nonspecific binding to DNA, one-dimensional (1D) diffusion along DNA segments, and 3D translocation among segments through cytoplasm at the single-molecule level. In searching for the operator, a lac repressor spends ∼90\% of time nonspecifically bound to and diffusing along DNA with a residence time of <5 milliseconds. The methods and findings can be generalized to other nucleic acid binding proteins.},

doi = {10.1073/pnas.0508637103}, 
abstract ={A fundamental question in biology is how the cell uses
                  transcription factors (TFs) to coordinate the
                  expression of thousands of genes in response to
                  various stimuli. The relationships between TFs and
                  their target genes can be modeled in terms of
                  directed regulatory networks. These relationships,
                  in turn, can be readily compared with commonplace
                  “chain-of-command” structures in social networks,
                  which have characteristic hierarchical
                  layouts. Here, we develop algorithms for identifying
                  generalized hierarchies (allowing for various loop
                  structures) and use these approaches to illuminate
                  extensive pyramid-shaped hierarchical structures
                  existing in the regulatory networks of
                  representative prokaryotes (Escherichia coli) and
                  eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), with most TFs
                  at the bottom levels and only a few master TFs on
                  top. These masters are situated near the center of
                  the protein–protein interaction network, a different
                  type of network from the regulatory one, and they
                  receive most of the input for the whole regulatory
                  hierarchy through protein interactions. Moreover,
                  they have maximal influence over other genes, in
                  terms of affecting expression-level
                  changes. Surprisingly, however, TFs at the bottom of
                  the regulatory hierarchy are more essential to the
                  viability of the cell. Finally, one might think
                  master TFs achieve their wide influence through
                  directly regulating many targets, but TFs with most
                  direct targets are in the middle of the
                  hierarchy. We find, in fact, that these midlevel TFs
                  are “control bottlenecks” in the hierarchy, and this
                  great degree of control for “middle managers” has
                  parallels in efficient social structures in various
                  corporate and governmental settings.},

abstract ={The genome has often been called the operating system (OS)
                  for a living organism. A computer OS is described by
                  a regulatory control network termed the call graph,
                  which is analogous to the transcriptional regulatory
                  network in a cell. To apply our firsthand knowledge
                  of the architecture of software systems to
                  understand cellular design principles, we present a
                  comparison between the transcriptional regulatory
                  network of a well-studied bacterium (Escherichia
                  coli) and the call graph of a canonical OS (Linux)
                  in terms of topology and evolution. We show that
                  both networks have a fundamentally hierarchical
                  layout, but there is a key difference: The
                  transcriptional regulatory network possesses a few
                  global regulators at the top and many targets at the
                  bottom; conversely, the call graph has many
                  regulators controlling a small set of generic
                  functions. This top-heavy organization leads to
                  highly overlapping functional modules in the call
                  graph, in contrast to the relatively independent
                  modules in the regulatory network. We further
                  develop a way to measure evolutionary rates
                  comparably between the two networks and explain this
                  difference in terms of network evolution. The
                  process of biological evolution via random mutation
                  and subsequent selection tightly constrains the
                  evolution of regulatory network hubs. The call
                  graph, however, exhibits rapid evolution of its
                  highly connected generic components, made possible
                  by designers’ continual fine-tuning. These findings
                  stem from the design principles of the two systems:
                  robustness for biological systems and cost
                  effectiveness (reuse) for software systems.},

abstract ={A site has been found that is required for repression of
                  the Escherichia coli araBAD operon. This site was
                  detected by the in vivo properties of deletion
                  mutants. In vitro protection studies with DNase I
                  and dimethylsulfate showed that araC protein can
                  specifically bind in this area to nucleotides lying
                  at position -265 to -294 with respect to the araBAD
                  operon promoter (PBAD) transcription start
                  point. The previously known sites of protein binding
                  in the ara operon lie between +20 and -160. Since
                  the properties of deletion strains show that all the
                  sites required for araBAD induction lie between +20
                  and -110, the new site at -280 exerts its repressive
                  action over an unusually large distance along the
                  DNA. Insertions of -16, -8, 0, 5, 11, 15, 24, and 31
                  base pairs of DNA between the new site and PBAD were
                  constructed. Repression was impaired in those cases
                  in which half-integral turns of the DNA helix were
                  introduced, but repression was nearly normal for the
                  insertions of 0, +11, and +31 base pairs.},

abstract ={Three binding sites for AraC protein were shown to be required for the autoregulation of araC: araI1, araO1, and araO2. Selective inactivation of AraC-binding sites on the DNA demonstrated that araO1 and araO2 are required in vivo to produce repression of araC in the presence of arabinose, whereas araI1 and araO2 are required in its absence. We found that the low-affinity site araO2 is essential for araC autoregulation; araO1 and araI1 provide high-affinity AraC-binding sites, which allow cooperative binding at araO2. Profound effects on the araBAD promoter and the araC promoter are produced by ligand-induced changes in AraC occupancy of functional sites on the DNA. We suggest that AraC exerts its multiplicity of controls through two alternative states of cooperative interactions with DNA and we illustrate this with a model. This model presents our interpretations of activation and repression of the araBAD operon and the autoregulation of the araC gene.},

                  repression or activation mediated by the cyclic AMP
                  receptor protein (Crp). The results reveal that many
                  operons encoding enzymes of central carbon metabolic
                  pathways (e.g., Krebs cycle enzymes), as well as
                  transporters and enzymes that initiate carbon
                  metabolism, are subject to direct Crp-mediated
                  catabolite repression. By contrast, few
                  enzyme-encoding genes (direct regulation) but many
                  ribosomal protein- and tRNA-encoding genes (indirect

                In this review we give an overview of computational and statistical methods to reconstruct cellular networks. Although this area of research is vast and fast developing, we show that most currently used methods can be organized by a few key concepts. The first part of the review deals with conditional independence models including Gaussian graphical models and Bayesian networks. The second part discusses probabilistic and graph-based methods for data from experimental interventions and perturbations.

abstract ={The goal of this group project has been to coordinate and bring up-to-date information on all genes of Escherichia coli K-12. Annotation of the genome of an organism entails identification of genes, the boundaries of genes in terms of precise start and end sites, and description of the gene products. Known and predicted functions were assigned to each gene product on the basis of experimental evidence or sequence analysis. Since both kinds of evidence are constantly expanding, no annotation is complete at any moment in time. This is a snapshot analysis based on the most recent genome sequences of two E.coli K-12 bacteria. An accurate and up-to-date description of E.coli K-12 genes is of particular importance to the scientific community because experimentally determined properties of its gene products provide fundamental information for annotation of innumerable genes of other organisms. Availability of the complete genome sequence of two K-12 strains allows comparison of their genotypes and mutant status of alleles.},

    abstract = {{We study theoretical "design principles" for transcription factor (TF)-DNA interaction in bacteria, focusing particularly on the statistical interaction of the TFs with the genomic background (i.e., the genome without the target sites). We introduce and motivate the concept of programmability, i.e., the ability to set the threshold concentration for TF binding over a wide range merely by mutating the binding sequence of a target site. This functional demand, together with physical constraints arising from the thermodynamics and kinetics of TF-DNA interaction, leads us to a narrow range of "optimal" interaction parameters. We find that this parameter set agrees well with experimental data for the interaction parameters of a few exemplary prokaryotic TFs, which indicates that TF-DNA interaction is indeed programmable. We suggest further experiments to test whether this is a general feature for a large class of TFs.}},

                Sigma factors provide promoter recognition specificity to RNA polymerase holoenzyme, contribute to DNA strand separation, and then dissociate from the core enzyme following transcription initiation. As the regulon of a single sigma factor can be composed of hundreds of genes, sigma factors can provide effective mechanisms for simultaneously regulating expression of large numbers of prokaryotic genes. One newly emerging field is identification of the specific roles of alternative sigma factors in regulating expression of virulence genes and virulence-associated genes in bacterial pathogens. Virulence genes encode proteins whose functions are essential for the bacterium to effectively establish an infection in a host organism. In contrast, virulence-associated genes can contribute to bacterial survival in the environment and therefore may enhance the capacity of the bacterium to spread to new individuals or to survive passage through a host organism. As alternative sigma factors have been shown to regulate expression of both virulence and virulence-associated genes, these proteins can contribute both directly and indirectly to bacterial virulence. Sigma factors are classified into two structurally unrelated families, the sigma70 and the sigma54 families. The sigma70 family includes primary sigma factors (e.g., Bacillus subtilis sigma(A)) as well as related alternative sigma factors; sigma54 forms a distinct subfamily of sigma factors referred to as sigma(N) in almost all species for which these proteins have been characterized to date. We present several examples of alternative sigma factors that have been shown to contribute to virulence in at least one organism. For each sigma factor, when applicable, examples are drawn from multiple species.

abstract={The initiation of transcription is the most important step for gene regulation in eubacteria. To initiate transcription, RNA polymerase has to associate with a small protein, known as a sigma-factor. The sigma-factor directs RNA polymerase to a specific class of promoter sequences. Most bacterial species synthesize several different sigma-factors that recognize different consensus sequences. This variety in sigma-factors provides bacteria with the opportunity to maintain basal gene expression as well as for regulation of gene expression in response to altered environmental or developmental signals. This review focuses on the function, regulation and distribution of the 14 different classes of sigma-factors that are presently known.}

Some characteristics of the SOS repair are (1) it is induced or activated following damage to DNA, (2) it requires do novo protein synthesis, (3) It requires several genetic functions of which the best-studied are recA+ and lex+ of E. coli, and (4) the physiological and genetic requirements for the expression of SOS repair are suspiciously similar to those necessary for the prophage induction. The SOS repair hypothesis has already served as the working hypothesis for many experiments, some of which are briefly reviewed. Also, some speculations are presented to stimulate further discussions and experimental tests.}

abstract={Integration host factor (IHF) of Escherichia coli is an asymmetric histone-like protein that binds and bends the DNA at specific sequences. IHF functions as an accessory factor in a wide variety of processes including replication, site-specific recombination and transcription. In many of these processes IHF was shown to act as an architectural element which helps the formation of nucleo-protein complexes by bending of the DNA at specific sites. This MicroReview shows how such a structural role of IHF can influence the initiation of transcription. In addition, it summarizes the evidence indicating that IHF can stimulate transcription via a direct interaction with RNA polymerase and explores the possibility that the asymmetry of the IHF protein might reflect such an interaction.}

abstract ={The Escherichia coli OmpR/EnvZ two-component regulatory system, which senses environmental osmolarity, also regulates biofilm formation. Up mutations in the ompRgene, such as the ompR234 mutation, stimulate laboratory strains of E. coli to grow as a biofilm community rather than in a planktonic state. In this report, we show that the OmpR234 protein promotes biofilm formation by binding the csgDpromoter region and stimulating its transcription. ThecsgD gene encodes the transcription regulator CsgD, which in turn activates transcription of the csgBAoperon encoding curli, extracellular structures involved in bacterial adhesion. Consistent with the role of the ompR gene as part of an osmolarity-sensing regulatory system, we also show that the formation of biofilm by E. coli is inhibited by increasing osmolarity in the growth medium. The ompR234mutation counteracts adhesion inhibition by high medium osmolarity; we provide evidence that the ompR234 mutation promotes biofilm formation by strongly increasing the initial adhesion of bacteria to an abiotic surface. This increase in initial adhesion is stationary phase dependent, but it is negatively regulated by the stationary-phase-specific sigma factor RpoS. We propose that this negative regulation takes place via rpoS-dependent transcription of the transcription regulator cpxR;cpxR-mediated repression of csgB andcsgD promoters is also triggered by osmolarity and by curli overproduction, in a feedback regulation loop.},

abstract ={Previously, the transfer of the phosphoryl group between the EnvZ and OmpR proteins, which are involved in activation of the ompF and ompC genes in response to the medium osmolarity, has been demonstrated in vitro. In this study, we characterized mutant EnvZ and OmpR proteins in terms of their in vitro phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The proteins isolated from the mutants, envZ11 and ompR3, were found to be defective in seemingly the same aspect, i.e. OmpR dephosphorylation. The protein isolated from the ompR77 mutant, which is a suppressor mutant specific for envZ11, was found to be defective in another aspect, i.e. OmpR phosphorylation. These results imply that the phosphotransfer reactions observed in vitro play roles in the mechanism underlying the osmoregulatory expression of the ompF and ompC genes in vivo. We provide evidence that the EnvZ protein is involved not only in OmpR phosphorylation but also in OmpR dephosphorylation.},

abstract ={The Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is a global regulator that controls transcription initiation from more than 100 promoters by binding to a specific DNA sequence within cognate promoters. Many genes in the CRP regulon have been predicted simply based on the presence of DNA-binding sites within gene promoters. In this study, we have exploited a newly developed technique, run-off transcription/microarray analysis (ROMA) to define CRP-regulated promoters. Using ROMA, we identified 176 operons that were activated by CRP in vitro and 16 operons that were repressed. Using positive control mutants in different regions of CRP, we were able to classify the different promoters into class I or class II/III. A total of 104 operons were predicted to contain Class II CRP-binding sites. Sequence analysis of the operons that were repressed by CRP revealed different mechanisms for CRP inhibition. In contrast, the in vivo transcriptional profiles failed to identify most CRP-dependent regulation because of the complexity of the regulatory network. Analysis of these operons supports the hypothesis that CRP is not only a regulator of genes required for catabolism of sugars other than glucose, but also regulates the expression of a large number of other genes in E.coli. ROMA has revealed 152 hitherto unknown CRP regulons.},

abstract ={The 4,639,221–base pair sequence of Escherichia coliK-12 is presented. Of 4288 protein-coding genes annotated, 38 percent have no attributed function. Comparison with five other sequenced microbes reveals ubiquitous as well as narrowly distributed gene families; many families of similar genes within E. coli are also evident. The largest family of paralogous proteins contains 80 ABC transporters. The genome as a whole is strikingly organized with respect to the local direction of replication; guanines, oligonucleotides possibly related to replication and recombination, and most genes are so oriented. The genome also contains insertion sequence (IS) elements, phage remnants, and many other patches of unusual composition indicating genome plasticity through horizontal transfer.},

abstract ={Motivation: Theoretical efforts to understand the regulation of gene expression are traditionally centered around the identification of transcription factor binding sites at specific DNA positions. More recently these efforts have been supplemented by experimental data for relative binding affinities of proteins to longer intergenic sequences. The question arises to what extent these two approaches converge. In this paper, we adopt a physical binding model to predict the relative binding affinity of a transcription factor for a given sequence.Results: We find that a significant fraction of genome-wide binding data in yeast can be accounted for by simple count matrices and a physical model with only two parameters. We demonstrate that our approach is both conceptually and practically more powerful than traditional methods, which require selection of a cutoff. Our analysis yields biologically meaningful parameters, suitable for predicting relative binding affinities in the absence of experimental binding data.Availability: The C source code for our TRAP program is freely available for non-commercial use at http://www.molgen.mpg.de/~manke/papers/TFaffinities/Contact:vingron@molgen.mpg.de},

abstract ={In vivo protein-DNA interactions connect each transcription factor with its direct targets to form a gene network scaffold. To map these protein-DNA interactions comprehensively across entire mammalian genomes, we developed a large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIPSeq) based on direct ultrahigh-throughput DNA sequencing. This sequence census method was then used to map in vivo binding of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF; also known as REST, for repressor element–1 silencing transcription factor) to 1946 locations in the human genome. The data display sharp resolution of binding position [±50 base pairs (bp)], which facilitated our finding motifs and allowed us to identify noncanonical NRSF-binding motifs. These ChIPSeq data also have high sensitivity and specificity [ROC (receiver operator characteristic) area ≥ 0.96] and statistical confidence (P <10–4), properties that were important for inferring new candidate interactions. These include key transcription factors in the gene network that regulates pancreatic islet cell development.},

abstract ={Gene expression is controlled primarily by transcription factors, whose DNA binding sites are typically 10 nt long. We develop a population-genetic model to understand how the length and information content of such binding sites evolve. Our analysis is based on an inherent trade-off between specificity, which is greater in long binding sites, and robustness to mutation, which is greater in short binding sites. The evolutionary stable distribution of binding site lengths predicted by the model agrees with the empirical distribution (5–31 nt, with mean 9.9 nt for eukaryotes), and it is remarkably robust to variation in the underlying parameters of population size, mutation rate, number of transcription factor targets, and strength of selection for proper binding and selection against improper binding. In a systematic data set of eukaryotic and prokaryotic transcription factors we also uncover strong relationships between the length of a binding site and its information content per nucleotide, as well as between the number of targets a transcription factor regulates and the information content in its binding sites. Our analysis explains these features as well as the remarkable conservation of binding site characteristics across diverse taxa.},

@article{hermsen2007,
    abstract = {Gene regulatory networks lie at the heart of cellular computation. In these networks, intracellular and extracellular signals are integrated by transcription factors, which control the expression of transcription units by binding to cis-regulatory regions on the {DNA}. The designs of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cis-regulatory regions are usually highly complex. They frequently consist of both repetitive and overlapping transcription factor binding sites. To unravel the design principles of these promoter architectures, we have designed in silico prokaryotic transcriptional logic gates with predefined input–output relations using an evolutionary algorithm. The resulting cis-regulatory designs are often composed of modules that consist of tandem arrays of binding sites to which the transcription factors bind cooperatively. Moreover, these modules often overlap with each other, leading to competition between them. Our analysis thus identifies a new signal integration motif that is based upon the interplay between intramodular cooperativity and intermodular competition. We show that this signal integration mechanism drastically enhances the capacity of cis-regulatory domains to integrate signals. Our results provide a possible explanation for the complexity of promoter architectures and could be used for the rational design of synthetic gene circuits. Transcription regulatory networks are the central processing units of living cells. They allow cells to integrate different intracellular and extracellular signals to recognize patterns in, for instance, the food supply of the organism. The elementary calculations are performed at the cis-regulatory domains of genes, where transcription factors bind to the {DNA} to regulate the expression level of the genes. The logic of the computations that are performed depends upon the design of the cis-regulatory region. Not only in eukaryotic cells, but also in prokaryotic cells, the architectures of the cis-regulatory regions are often highly complex. They often contain long arrays of transcription factor binding sites. Moreover, the binding sites often overlap with one another. Hermsen, Tans, and ten Wolde discuss whether such complex architectures can be explained from the basic function of cis-regulatory regions to integrate signals. The authors combine a physicochemical model of prokaryotic transcription regulation with an evolutionary algorithm to design cis-regulatory constructs with predefined elementary functions. The resulting architectures make extensive use of repeating binding sites that are organized into cooperative modules. More surprisingly, these modules often overlap with each other, leading to competition between them. This interplay between intramodular cooperativity and intermodular competition is a powerful mechanism to achieve complex functionality, which may explain the daunting complexity of promoter architectures found in nature.},

    abstract = {Maximum likelihood estimates ({MLEs}) in autologistic models and other exponential family models for dependent data can be calculated with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (the Metropolis algorithm or the Gibbs sampler), which simulate ergodic Markov chains having equilibrium distributions in the model. From one realization of such a Markov chain, a Monte Carlo approximant to the whole likelihood function can be constructed. The parameter value (if any) maximizing this function approximates the {MLE}. When no parameter point in the model maximizes the likelihood, the {MLE} in the closure of the exponential family may exist and can be calculated by a two-phase algorithm, first finding the support of the {MLE} by linear programming and then finding the distribution within the family conditioned on the support by maximizing the likelihood for that family. These methods are illustrated by a constrained autologistic model for {DNA} fingerprint data. {MLEs} are compared with maximum pseudolikelihood estimates ({MPLEs}) and with maximum conditional likelihood estimates ({MCLEs}), neither of which produce acceptable estimates, the {MPLE} because it overestimates dependence, and the {MCLE} because conditioning removes the constraints.},

@article{gelman98,
    abstract = {Computing (ratios of) normalizing constants of probability
models is a fundamental computational problem for many statistical and
scientific studies. Monte Carlo simulation is an effective technique, especially with complex and high-dimensional models. This paper aims to
bring to the attention of general statistical audiences of some effective
methods originating from theoretical physics and at the same time to explore these methods from a more statistical perspective, through establishing theoretical connections and illustrating their uses with statistical
problems. We show that the acceptance ratio method and thermodynamic
integration are natural generalizations of importance sampling, which is
most familiar to statistical audiences. The former generalizes importance
sampling through the use of a single "bridge" density and is thus a case
of bridge sampling in the sense of Meng and Wong. Thermodynamic
integration, which is also known in the numerical analysis literature
as Ogata's method for high-dimensional integration, corresponds to the
use of infinitely many and continuously connected bridges (and thus a
"path"). Our path sampling formulation offers more flexibility and thus
potential efficiency to thermodynamic integration, and the search of optimal paths turns out to have close connections with the Jeffreys prior
density and the Rao and Hellinger distances between two densities. We
provide an informative theoretical example as well as two empirical examples (involving 17- to 70-dimensional integrations) to illustrate the
potential and implementation of path sampling. We also discuss some
open problems.},

@article{kaohuang77,
    abstract = {Binding of genome regulatory proteins to nonspecific {DNA} sites may play an important role in controlling the thermodynamics and kinetics of the interactions of these proteins with their specific target {DNA} sequences. An estimate of the fraction of Escherichia coli lac repressor molecules bound in vivo to the operator region and to nonoperator sites on the E. coli chromosome is derived by measurement of the distribution of repressor between a minicell-producing E. coli strain (P678-54) and the {DNA}-free minicells derived therefrom. Assuming the minicell cytoplasm to be representative of that of the parent E. coli cells, we find that less than 10\% of the repressor tetramers of the average cell are free in solution; the remainder are presumed to be bound to the bacterial chromosome. The minimum in vivo value of the association constant for repressor to bulk nonoperator {DNA} ({K(RD})) calculated from these results is about 10(3) M(-1), and analysis of the sources of error in the minicell experiment suggests that the actual in vivo value of {K(RD}) could be substantially greater. The value of {K(RD}), coupled with in vitro data on the ionic strength dependence of this parameter, can be used to estimate that the effective intracellular cation activity of E. coli is no greater than about 0.24 M (and probably no less than 0.17 M) in terms of sodium ion equivalents. The minicell distribution experiments also confirm that the association constant for the binding of inducer-repressor complex to bulk nonoperator {DNA} ({K(RID})) is [unk] {K(RD})in vivo. These results are used to calculate minimum in vivo values of {K(RO}) and {K(RIO}) (association constants for repressor and for inducer-repressor complex binding to operator) of about 10(12) M(-1) and about 10(9) M(-1), respectively. The results fit a quantitative model for operon regulation in which nonspecific {DNA}-repressor complexes play a key role in determining basal and constitutive levels of gene expression [von Hippel, P.

We describe a high-throughput microfluidic platform that measures such properties on the basis of mechanical trapping of molecular interactions.

abstract={The DNA damage response is crucial for bacterial survival. The transcriptional repressor LexA is a key component of the SOS response, the main mechanism for the regulation of DNA repair genes in many bacteria. In contrast, in mycobacteria gene induction by DNA damage is carried out by two mechanisms; a relatively small number of genes are thought to be regulated by LexA, and a larger number by an alternate, independent mechanism. In this study we have used ChIP-seq analysis to identify 25 in vivo LexA-binding sites, including nine regulating genes not previously known to be part of this regulon. Some of these binding sites were found to be internal to the predicted open reading frame of the gene they are thought to regulate; experimental analysis has confirmed that these LexA-binding sites regulate the expression of the expected genes, and transcriptional start site analysis has found that their apparent relative location is due to misannotation of these genes. We have also identified novel binding sites for LexA in the promoters of genes that show no apparent DNA damage induction, show positive regulation by LexA, and those encoding small RNAs. }

    abstract = {The Hill coefficient is often used as a direct measure of the cooperativity of binding processes. It is an essential tool for probing properties of reactions in many biochemical systems. Here, we analyze existing experimental data and demonstrate that the Hill coefficient characterizing the binding of transcription factors to their cognate sites can in fact be larger than one-the standard indication of cooperativity-even in the absence of any standard cooperative binding mechanism. We demonstrate that this effect occurs due to the disordered binding energy of transcription factors to the {DNA} molecule and the steric repulsion between the different copies of the transcription factor. We show that the enhanced Hill coefficient implies a significant reduction in the number of copies of the transcription factors which is needed to occupy a cognate site and, in many cases, can explain existing estimates for number of copies of the transcription factors in cells.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Knowledge about the abundance of molecular components is an important prerequisite for building quantitative predictive models of cellular behavior. Proteins are central components of these models, since they carry out most of the fundamental processes in the cell. Thus far, protein concentrations have been difficult to measure on a large scale, but proteomic technologies have now advanced to a stage where this information becomes readily {accessible.RESULTS}:Here, we describe an experimental scheme to maximize the coverage of proteins identified by mass spectrometry of a complex biological sample. Using a combination of {LC}-{MS}/{MS} approaches with protein and peptide fractionation steps we identified 1103 proteins from the cytosolic fraction of the Escherichia coli strain {MC4100}. A measure of abundance is presented for each of the identified proteins, based on the recently developed {emPAI} approach which takes into account the number of sequenced peptides per protein. The values of abundance are within a broad range and accurately reflect independently measured copy numbers per {cell.As} expected, the most abundant proteins were those involved in protein synthesis, most notably ribosomal proteins. Proteins involved in energy metabolism as well as those with binding function were also found in high copy number while proteins annotated with the terms metabolism, transcription, transport, and cellular organization were rare. The barrel-sandwich fold was found to be the structural fold with the highest abundance. Highly abundant proteins are predicted to be less prone to aggregation based on their length, {pI} values, and occurrence patterns of hydrophobic stretches. We also find that abundant proteins tend to be predominantly essential. Additionally we observe a significant correlation between protein and {mRNA} abundance in E. coli {cells.CONCLUSION}:Abundance measurements for more than 1000 E. coli proteins presented in this work represent the most complete study of protein abundance in a bacterial cell so far. We show significant associations between the abundance of a protein and its properties and functions in the cell. In this way, we provide both data and novel insights into the role of protein concentration in this model organism.},

                The analysis of regulatory regions in genome sequences is strongly based on the detection of potential transcription factor binding sites. The preferred models for representation of transcription factor binding specificity have been termed position-specific scoring matrices. {JASPAR} is an open-access database of annotated, high-quality, matrix-based transcription factor binding site profiles for multicellular eukaryotes. The profiles were derived exclusively from sets of nucleotide sequences experimentally demonstrated to bind transcription factors. The database is complemented by a web interface for browsing, searching and subset selection, an online sequence analysis utility and a suite of programming tools for genome-wide and comparative genomic analysis of regulatory regions. {JASPAR} is available at http://jaspar. cgb.ki.se.

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:The regulation of a gene depends on the binding of transcription factors to specific sites located in the regulatory region of the gene. The generation of these binding sites and of cooperativity between them are essential building blocks in the evolution of complex regulatory networks. We study a theoretical model for the sequence evolution of binding sites by point mutations. The approach is based on biophysical models for the binding of transcription factors to {DNA}. Hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes, which enter a population genetics model including mutations, genetic drift, and {selection.RESULTS}:We show that the selection for factor binding generically leads to specific correlations between nucleotide frequencies at different positions of a binding site. We demonstrate the possibility of rapid adaptive evolution generating a new binding site for a given transcription factor by point mutations. The evolutionary time required is estimated in terms of the neutral (background) mutation rate, the selection coefficient, and the effective population {size.CONCLUSIONS}:The efficiency of binding site formation is seen to depend on two joint conditions: the binding site motif must be short enough and the promoter region must be long enough. These constraints on promoter architecture are indeed seen in eukaryotic systems. Furthermore, we analyse the adaptive evolution of genetic switches and of signal integration through binding cooperativity between different sites. Experimental tests of this picture involving the statistics of polymorphisms and phylogenies of sites are discussed.},

    abstract = {The most detailed information presently available for an organism's transcriptional regulation network is that for the prokaryote Escherichia coli. In order to gain insight into the evolution of the E.coli regulatory network, we analysed information obtainable for the domains and protein families of the transcription factors and regulated genes. About three‐quarters of the 271 transcription factors we identified are two‐domain proteins, consisting of a {DNA}‐binding domain along with a regulatory domain. The regulatory domains mainly bind small molecules. Many groups of transcription factors have identical domain architectures, and this implies that roughly three‐quarters of the transcription factors have arisen as a consequence of gene duplication. In contrast, there is little evidence of duplication of regulatory regions together with regulated genes or of transcription factors together with regulated genes. Thirty‐eight, out of the 121 transcription factors for which one or more regulated genes are known, regulate other transcription factors. This amplification effect, as well as large differences between the numbers of genes directly regulated by transcription factors, means that there are about 10 global regulators which each control many more genes than the other transcription factors.},

@article{dekel05,
    abstract = {Different proteins have different expression levels. It is unclear to what extent these expression levels are optimized to their environment. Evolutionary theories suggest that protein expression levels maximize fitness1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, but the fitness as a function of protein level has seldom been directly measured. To address this, we studied the lac system of Escherichia coli, which allows the cell to use the sugar lactose for growth12. We experimentally measured the growth burden13, 14 due to production and maintenance of the Lac proteins (cost), as well as the growth advantage (benefit) conferred by the Lac proteins when lactose is present. The fitness function, given by the difference between the benefit and the cost, predicts that for each lactose environment there exists an optimal Lac expression level that maximizes growth rate. We then performed serial dilution evolution experiments at different lactose concentrations. In a few hundred generations, cells evolved to reach the predicted optimal expression levels. Thus, protein expression from the lac operon seems to be a solution of a cost–benefit optimization problem, and can be rapidly tuned by evolution to function optimally in new environments.},

The mutant with the lowest transcription activation of the {araBAD} promoter was studied further. It proved to alter a residue that had previously been demonstrated to contact {DNA.} Because the overproduced mutant protein still bound {DNA} in vivo, it is deficient in transcription activation for some reason other than absence of {DNA} binding. Using the phase-sensitive {DNA} bending assay, we found that wild-type {AraC} bends {DNA} about 90 degrees whereas the mutant bends {DNA} by a smaller amount.},

@article{tomovic07,
    abstract = {Motivation: Most of the available tools for transcription factor binding site prediction are based on methods which assume no sequence dependence between the binding site base positions. Our primary objective was to investigate the statistical basis for either a claim of dependence or independence, to determine whether such a claim is generally true, and to use the resulting data to develop improved scoring functions for binding-site {prediction.Results}: Using three statistical tests, we analyzed the number of binding sites showing dependent positions. We analyzed transcription {factor–DNA} crystal structures for evidence of position dependence. Our final conclusions were that some factors show evidence of dependencies whereas others do not. We observed that the conformational energy (Z-score) of the transcription {factor–DNA} complexes was lower (better) for sequences that showed dependency than for those that did not (P < 0.02). We suggest that where evidence exists for dependencies, these should be modeled to improve binding-site predictions. However, when no significant dependency is found, this correction should be omitted. This may be done by converting any existing scoring function which assumes independence into a form which includes a dependency correction. We present an example of such an algorithm and its implementation as a web {tool.Availability}: {http://promoterplot.fmi.ch/cgi-bin/dep.htmlContact}: {edward.oakeley@fmi.chSupplementary} information: Supplementary data (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract ={The genetic code is redundant with most amino acids using multiple codons. In many organisms, codon usage is biased toward particular codons. Understanding the adaptive and nonadaptive forces driving the evolution of codon usage bias (CUB) has been an area of intense focus and debate in the fields of molecular and evolutionary biology. However, their relative importance in shaping genomic patterns of CUB remains unsolved. Using a nested model of protein translation and population genetics, we show that observed gene level variation of CUB in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be explained almost entirely by selection for efficient ribosomal usage, genetic drift, and biased mutation. The correlation between observed codon counts within individual genes and our model predictions is 0.96. Although a variety of factors shape patterns of CUB at the level of individual sites within genes, our results suggest that selection for efficient ribosome usage is a central force in shaping codon usage at the genomic scale. In addition, our model allows direct estimation of codon-specific mutation rates and elongation times and can be readily applied to any organism with high-throughput expression datasets. More generally, we have developed a natural framework for integrating models of molecular processes to population genetics models to quantitatively estimate parameters underlying fundamental biological processes, such a protein translation.},

In the search for its target site, the DNA-associated protein is facing both thermodynamic and kinetic difficulties. The thermodynamic challenge lies in recognizing and tightly binding a cognate (specific) site among the billions of other (non-specific) sequences on the DNA. The kinetic difficulty lies in finding a cognate site in mere seconds amidst the crowded cellular environment that is filled with other DNA sequences and proteins. Herein, we discuss the history of the DNA search problem, the theoretical background and the various experimental methods used to study the kinetics of proteins searching for target sites on DNA.},

Challenges in the standard {ChIP}–seq protocol have motivated recent enhancements in this approach, such as reducing the number of cells that are required and increasing the resolution. Complementary experimental approaches — for example, {DNaseI} hypersensitive site mapping and analysis of chromatin interactions that are mediated by particular proteins — provide additional information about {DNA}-binding proteins and their function. These data are now being used to identify variability in the functions of {DNA}-binding proteins across genomes and individuals.

abstract ={The mechanism by which the internal lacZ gene sequence O2 influences lac repression was investigated by using in vivo footprinting of operon mutants. Quantitative in vivo binding curves show that O2 strengthens by approximately 3-fold repressor binding to O1 that is located 400 base pairs upstream at the transcription start site. The internal O2 sequence also contributes to repression by a second mechanism: repressor bound internally blocks elongation of beta-galactosidase gene expression. This secondary mechanism of repression is facilitated by the remote O1 operator that strengthens binding to O2 12-fold. Thus, lac repression involves two mechanisms, both of which involve cooperation between remote operator elements. During mild repression only the initiation mechanism applies, but more severe repression favors formation of the presumptive O1-O2 repression loop that allows both mechanisms to act simultaneously.},

Some of these (z mutations) are expressed by loss of the capacity to synthesize active enzyme. Others (i mutations) allow the enzyme to be synthesized constitutively instead of inducibly as in the wild type. The study of galactosidase synthesis in heteromerozygotes of E. coli indicates that the z and i mutations belong to different cistrons. Moreover the constitutive allele of the i cistron is recessive over the inducible allele. The kinetics of expression of the i+ (inducible) character suggest that the i gene controls the synthesis of a specific substance which represses the synthesis of (β-galactosidase. The constitutive state results from loss of the capacity to synthesize active repressor. "

<p>Next-generation DNA sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) is revolutionizing our ability to interrogate whole genome protein-DNA interactions. Identification of protein binding sites from ChIP-seq data has required novel computational tools, distinct from those used for the analysis of ChIP-Chip experiments. The growing popularity of ChIP-seq spurred the development of many different analytical programs (at last count, we noted 31 open source methods), each with some purported advantage. Given that the literature is dense and empirical benchmarking challenging, selecting an appropriate method for ChIP-seq analysis has become a daunting task. Herein we compare the performance of eleven different peak calling programs on common empirical, transcription factor datasets and measure their sensitivity, accuracy and usability. Our analysis provides an unbiased critical assessment of available technologies, and should assist researchers in choosing a suitable tool for handling ChIP-seq data.</p>

    abstract = {Accurate identification of the {DNA}-binding sites of transcription factors and other {DNA}-binding proteins on the genome is crucial to understanding their molecular interactions with {DNA}. Here, we describe a new method: Genome Footprinting by high-throughput sequencing ({GeF}-seq), which combines in vivo {DNase} I digestion of genomic {DNA} with {ChIP} coupled with high-throughput sequencing. We have determined the in vivo binding sites of a Bacillus subtilis global regulator, {AbrB}, using {GeF}-seq. This method shows that exact {DNA}-binding sequences, which were protected from in vivo {DNase} I digestion, were resolved at a comparable resolution to that achieved by in vitro {DNase} I footprinting, and this was simply attained without the necessity of prediction by peak-calling programs. Moreover, {DNase} I digestion of the bacterial nucleoid resolved the closely positioned {AbrB}-binding sites, which had previously appeared as one peak in {ChAP}-chip and {ChAP}-seq experiments. The high-resolution determination of {AbrB}-binding sites using {GeF}-seq enabled us to identify bipartite {TGGNA} motifs in 96\% of the {AbrB}-binding sites. Interestingly, in a thousand binding sites with very low-binding intensities, single {TGGNA} motifs were also identified. Thus, {GeF}-seq is a powerful method to elucidate the molecular mechanism of target protein binding to its cognate {DNA} sequences.},

We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the binding of MelR and RNA polymerase to the melAB promoter in vivo. Our results show that MelR is associated with promoter DNA, both in the absence and presence of the inducer melibiose. In contrast, RNA polymerase is recruited to the melAB promoter only in the presence of inducer. The MelR DK261 positive control mutant binds to the melAB promoter but cannot recruit RNA polymerase. Further analysis of immunoprecipitated DNA, by using an Affymetrix GeneChip array, showed that the melAB promoter is the major, if not the sole, target in E. coli for MelR. This was confirmed by a transcriptomics experiment to analyze RNA in cells either with or without melR.},

doi = {10.1073/pnas.1004290107}, 
abstract ={Cells use protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions to regulate transcription. A biophysical understanding of this process has, however, been limited by the lack of methods for quantitatively characterizing the interactions that occur at specific promoters and enhancers in living cells. Here we show how such biophysical information can be revealed by a simple experiment in which a library of partially mutated regulatory sequences are partitioned according to their in vivo transcriptional activities and then sequenced en masse. Computational analysis of the sequence data produced by this experiment can provide precise quantitative information about how the regulatory proteins at a specific arrangement of binding sites work together to regulate transcription. This ability to reliably extract precise information about regulatory biophysics in the face of experimental noise is made possible by a recently identified relationship between likelihood and mutual information. Applying our experimental and computational techniques to the Escherichia coli lac promoter, we demonstrate the ability to identify regulatory protein binding sites de novo, determine the sequence-dependent binding energy of the proteins that bind these sites, and, importantly, measure the in vivo interaction energy between RNA polymerase and a DNA-bound transcription factor. Our approach provides a generally applicable method for characterizing the biophysical basis of transcriptional regulation by a specified regulatory sequence. The principles of our method can also be applied to a wide range of other problems in molecular biology.},

Although these studies uncovered strong sequence-strength correlations, the cost of their elaborate experimental methods have been too high to be applied to a large number of promoters. On the contrary, a recent increase in the microarray data allows us to compare thousands of gene expressions with their DNA sequences.Results: We studied the relations between the promoter sequences and their strengths using the Escherichia coli microarray data. We modeled those relations using a simple weight matrix, which was optimized with a novel support vector regression method. It was observed that several non-consensus bases in the ‘−35’ and ‘−10’ regions of promoter sequences act positively on the promoter strength and that certain consensus bases have a minor effect on the strength. We analyzed outliers for which the observed gene expressions deviate from the promoter strength predictions, and identified several genes with enhanced expressions due to multiple promoters and genes under strong regulation by transcription factors. Our method is applicable to other procaryotes for which both the promoter sequences and the microarray data are available.Contact: hisano-k@is.aist-nara.ac.jp},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Characterizing transcription factor
                  binding motifs is a common bioinformatics task. For
                  transcription factors with variable binding sites,
                  we need to get many suboptimal binding sites in our
                  training dataset to get accurate estimates of free
                  energy penalties for deviating from the consensus
                  {DNA} sequence. One procedure to do that involves a
                  modified {SELEX} (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by
                  Exponential Enrichment) method designed to produce
                  many such {sequences.RESULTS}:We analyzed low
                  stringency {SELEX} data for E. coli Catabolic
                  Activator Protein ({CAP}), and we show here that
                  appropriate quantitative analysis improves our
                  ability to predict in vitro affinity. To obtain
                  large number of sequences required for this analysis
                  we used a {SELEX} {SAGE} protocol developed by
                  Roulet et al. The sequences obtained from here were
                  subjected to bioinformatic analysis. The resulting
                  bioinformatic model characterizes the sequence
                  specificity of the protein more accurately than
                  those sequence specificities predicted from previous
                  analysis just by using a few known binding sites
                  available in the literature. The consequences of
                  this increase in accuracy for prediction of in vivo
                  binding sites (and especially functional ones) in
                  the E. coli genome are also discussed. We measured
                  the dissociation constants of several putative {CAP}
                  binding sites by {EMSA} (Electrophoretic Mobility
                  Shift Assay) and compared the affinities to the
                  bioinformatics scores provided by methods like the
                  weight matrix method and {QPMEME} (Quadratic
                  Programming Method of Energy Matrix Estimation)
                  trained on known binding sites as well as on the new
                  sites from {SELEX} {SAGE} data. We also checked
                  predicted genome sites for conservation in the
                  related species S. typhimurium. We found that
                  bioinformatics scores based on {SELEX} {SAGE} data
                  does better in terms of prediction of physical
                  binding energies as well as in detecting functional
                  {sites.CONCLUSION}:We think that training binding
                  site detection algorithms on datasets from binding
                  assays lead to better prediction. The improvements
                  in accuracy came from the unbiased nature of the
                  {SELEX} dataset rather than from the number of sites
                  available. We believe that with progress in
                  short-read sequencing technology, one could use
                  {SELEX} methods to characterize binding affinities
                  of many low specificity transcription factors.},

    abstract = {Rule-based modeling involves the representation of molecules as structured objects and molecular interactions as rules for transforming the attributes of these objects. The approach is notable in that it allows one to systematically incorporate site-specific details about protein—protein interactions into a model for the dynamics of a signal-transduction system, but the method has other applications as well, such as following the fates of individual carbon atoms in metabolic reactions. The consequences of protein—protein interactions are difficult to specify and track with a conventional modeling approach because of the large number of protein phosphoforms and protein complexes that these interactions potentially generate. Here, we focus on how a rule-based model is specified in the {BioNetGen} language ({BNGL}) and how a model specification is analyzed using the {BioNetGen} software tool. We also discuss new developments in rule-based modeling that should enable the construction and analyses of comprehensive models for signal transduction pathways and similarly large-scale models for other biochemical systems.},

    abstract = {Finding where transcription factors ({TFs}) bind to the {DNA} is of key importance to decipher gene regulation at a transcriptional level. Classically, computational prediction of {TF} binding sites ({TFBSs}) is based on basic position weight matrices ({PWMs}) which quantitatively score binding motifs based on the observed nucleotide patterns in a set of {TFBSs} for the corresponding {TF}. Such models make the strong assumption that each nucleotide participates independently in the corresponding {DNA}-protein interaction and do not account for flexible length motifs. We introduce transcription factor flexible models ({TFFMs}) to represent {TF} binding properties. Based on hidden Markov models, {TFFMs} are flexible, and can model both position interdependence within {TFBSs} and variable length motifs within a single dedicated framework. The availability of thousands of experimentally validated {DNA}-{TF} interaction sequences from {ChIP}-seq allows for the generation of models that perform as well as {PWMs} for stereotypical {TFs} and can improve performance for {TFs} with flexible binding characteristics. We present a new graphical representation of the motifs that convey properties of position interdependence. {TFFMs} have been assessed on {ChIP}-seq data sets coming from the {ENCODE} project, revealing that they can perform better than both {PWMs} and the dinucleotide weight matrix extension in discriminating {ChIP}-seq from background sequences. Under the assumption that {ChIP}-seq signal values are correlated with the affinity of the {TF}-{DNA} binding, we find that {TFFM} scores correlate with {ChIP}-seq peak signals. Moreover, using available {TF}-{DNA} affinity measurements for the Max {TF}, we demonstrate that {TFFMs} constructed from {ChIP}-seq data correlate with published experimentally measured {DNA}-binding affinities. Finally, {TFFMs} allow for the straightforward computation of an integrated {TF} occupancy score across a sequence. These results demonstrate the capacity of {TFFMs} to accurately model {DNA}-protein interactions, while providing a single unified framework suitable for the next generation of {TFBS} prediction. Transcription factors are critical proteins for sequence-specific control of transcriptional regulation. Finding where these proteins bind to {DNA} is of key importance for global efforts to decipher the complex mechanisms of gene regulation. Greater understanding of the regulation of transcription promises to improve human genetic analysis by specifying critical gene components that have eluded investigators. Classically, computational prediction of transcription factor binding sites ({TFBS}) is based on models giving weights to each nucleotide at each position. We introduce a novel statistical model for the prediction of {TFBS} tolerant of a broader range of {TFBS} configurations than can be conveniently accommodated by existing methods. The new models are designed to address the confounding properties of nucleotide composition, inter-positional sequence dependence and variable lengths (e.g. variable spacing between half-sites) observed in the more comprehensive experimental data now emerging. The new models generate scores consistent with {DNA}-protein affinities measured experimentally and can be represented graphically, retaining desirable attributes of past methods. It demonstrates the capacity of the new approach to accurately assess {DNA}-protein interactions. With the rich experimental data generated from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, a greater diversity of {TFBS} properties has emerged that can now be accommodated within a single predictive approach.},

abstract ={We can determine the effects of many possible sequence variations in transcription factor binding sites using microarray binding experiments. Analysis of wild-type and mutant Zif268 (Egr1) zinc fingers bound to microarrays containing all possible central 3 bp triplet binding sites indicates that the nucleotides of transcription factor binding sites cannot be treated independently. This indicates that the current practice of characterizing transcription factor binding sites by mutating individual positions of binding sites one base pair at a time does not provide a true picture of the sequence specificity. Similarly, current bioinformatic practices using either just a consensus sequence, or even mononucleotide frequency weight matrices to provide more complete descriptions of transcription factor binding sites, are not accurate in depicting the true binding site specificities, since these methods rely upon the assumption that the nucleotides of binding sites exert independent effects on binding affinity. Our results stress the importance of complete reference tables of all possible binding sites for comparing protein binding preferences for various DNA sequences. We also show results suggesting that microarray binding data using particular subsets of all possible binding sites can be used to extrapolate the relative binding affinities of all possible full-length binding sites, given a known binding site for use as a starting sequence for site preference refinement.},

Here we show that a precise mathematical analogy can be drawn between certain evolutionary and thermodynamic systems, allowing application of the powerful machinery of statistical physics to analysis of a family of evolutionary models. Analytical results that follow directly from this approach include the steady-state distribution of fixed genotypes and the load in finite populations. The analogy with statistical physics also reveals that, contrary to a basic tenet of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the frequencies of adaptive and deleterious substitutions at steady state are equal. Finally, just as the free energy function quantitatively characterizes the balance between energy and entropy, a free fitness function provides an analytical expression for the balance between natural selection and stochastic drift.},

abstract ={Accurately characterizing transcription factor (TF)-DNA affinity is a central goal of regulatory genomics. Although thermodynamics provides the most natural language for describing the continuous range of TF-DNA affinity, traditional motif discovery algorithms focus instead on classification paradigms that aim to discriminate ‘bound’ and ‘unbound’ sequences. Moreover, these algorithms do not directly model the distribution of tags in ChIP-seq data. Here, we present a new algorithm named Thermodynamic Modeling of ChIP-seq (TherMos), which directly estimates a position-specific binding energy matrix (PSEM) from ChIP-seq/exo tag profiles. In cross-validation tests on seven genome-wide TF-DNA binding profiles, one of which we generated via ChIP-seq on a complex developing tissue, TherMos predicted quantitative TF-DNA binding with greater accuracy than five well-known algorithms. We experimentally validated TherMos binding energy models for Klf4 and Esrrb, using a novel protocol to measure PSEMs in vitro. Strikingly, our measurements revealed strong non-additivity at multiple positions within the two PSEMs. Among the algorithms tested, only TherMos was able to model the entire binding energy landscape of Klf4 and Esrrb. Our study reveals new insights into the energetics of TF-DNA binding in vivo and provides an accurate first-principles approach to binding energy inference from ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo data.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Unraveling the mechanisms that regulate gene expression is a major challenge in biology. An important task in this challenge is to identify regulatory elements, especially the binding sites in deoxyribonucleic acid ({DNA}) for transcription factors. These binding sites are short {DNA} segments that are called motifs. Recent advances in genome sequence availability and in high-throughput gene expression analysis technologies have allowed for the development of computational methods for motif finding. As a result, a large number of motif finding algorithms have been implemented and applied to various motif models over the past decade. This survey reviews the latest developments in {DNA} motif finding {algorithms.RESULTS}:Earlier algorithms use promoter sequences of coregulated genes from single genome and search for statistically overrepresented motifs. Recent algorithms are designed to use phylogenetic footprinting or orthologous sequences and also an integrated approach where promoter sequences of coregulated genes and phylogenetic footprinting are used. All the algorithms studied have been reported to correctly detect the motifs that have been previously detected by laboratory experimental approaches, and some algorithms were able to find novel motifs. However, most of these motif finding algorithms have been shown to work successfully in yeast and other lower organisms, but perform significantly worse in higher {organisms.CONCLUSION}:Despite considerable efforts to date, {DNA} motif finding remains a complex challenge for biologists and computer scientists. Researchers have taken many different approaches in developing motif discovery tools and the progress made in this area of research is very encouraging. Performance comparison of different motif finding tools and identification of the best tools have proven to be a difficult task because tools are designed based on algorithms and motif models that are diverse and complex and our incomplete understanding of the biology of regulatory mechanism does not always provide adequate evaluation of underlying algorithms over motif models.},

More than a hundred different computational methods have been proposed, and it is difficult to make an informed choice. Therefore, robust assessment of motif discovery methods becomes important, both for validation of existing tools and for identification of promising directions for future {research.RESULTS}:We use a machine learning perspective to analyze collections of transcription factors with known binding sites. Algorithms are presented for finding position weight matrices ({PWMs}), {IUPAC}-type motifs and mismatch motifs with optimal discrimination of binding sites from remaining sequence. We show that for many data sets in a recently proposed benchmark suite for motif discovery, none of the common motif models can accurately discriminate the binding sites from remaining sequence. This may obscure the distinction between the potential performance of the motif discovery tool itself versus the intrinsic complexity of the problem we are trying to solve. Synthetic data sets may avoid this problem, but we show on some previously proposed benchmarks that there may be a strong bias towards a presupposed motif model. We also propose a new approach to benchmark data set construction. This approach is based on collections of binding site fragments that are ranked according to the optimal level of discrimination achieved with our algorithms. This allows us to select subsets with specific properties. We present one benchmark suite with data sets that allow good discrimination between positive and negative instances with the common motif models. These data sets are suitable for evaluating algorithms for motif discovery that rely on these models. We present another benchmark suite where {PWM}, {IUPAC} and mismatch motif models are not able to discriminate reliably between positive and negative instances.

@article{simcha12,
    abstract = {A major challenge in molecular biology is reverse-engineering the cis-regulatory logic that plays a major role in the control of gene expression. This program includes searching through {DNA} sequences to identify  ” motifs” that serve as the binding sites for transcription factors or, more generally, are predictive of gene expression across cellular conditions. Several approaches have been proposed for de novo motif discovery–searching sequences without prior knowledge of binding sites or nucleotide patterns. However, unbiased validation is not straightforward. We consider two approaches to unbiased validation of discovered motifs: testing the statistical significance of a motif using a {DNA}  ” background” sequence model to represent the null hypothesis and measuring performance in predicting membership in gene clusters. We demonstrate that the background models typically used are  ” too null,” resulting in overly optimistic assessments of significance, and argue that performance in predicting {TF} binding or expression patterns from {DNA} motifs should be assessed by held-out data, as in predictive learning. Applying this criterion to common motif discovery methods resulted in universally poor performance, although there is a marked improvement when motifs are statistically significant against real background sequences. Moreover, on synthetic data where  ” ground truth” is known, discriminative performance of all algorithms is far below the theoretical upper bound, with pronounced  ” over-fitting” in training. A key conclusion from this work is that the failure of de novo discovery approaches to accurately identify motifs is basically due to statistical intractability resulting from the fixed size of co-regulated gene clusters, and thus such failures do not necessarily provide evidence that unfound motifs are not active biologically. Consequently, the use of prior knowledge to enhance motif discovery is not just advantageous but necessary. An implementation of the {LR} and {ALR} algorithms is available at http://code.google.com/p/likelihood-rati​o-motifs/.},

    abstract = {A wealth of protein and {DNA} sequence data is being generated by genome projects and other sequencing efforts. A crucial barrier to deciphering these sequences and understanding the relations among them is the difficulty of detecting subtle local residue patterns common to multiple sequences. Such patterns frequently reflect similar molecular structures and biological properties. A mathematical definition of this "local multiple alignment" problem suitable for full computer automation has been used to develop a new and sensitive algorithm, based on the statistical method of iterative sampling. This algorithm finds an optimized local alignment model for N sequences in N-linear time, requiring only seconds on current workstations, and allows the simultaneous detection and optimization of multiple patterns and pattern repeats. The method is illustrated as applied to helix-turn-helix proteins, lipocalins, and prenyltransferases.},

@article{geman84,
    abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field ({MRF}) equivalence, this assignment also determines an {MRF} image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the {MRF}. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an {MRF} with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for {MAP} estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

    abstract = {Identification of transcription factor binding sites within regulatory segments of genomic {DNA} is an important step toward understanding of the regulatory circuits that control expression of genes. Here, we describe a novel bioinformatics method that bases classification of potential binding sites explicitly on the estimate of sequence-specific binding energy of a given transcription factor. The method also estimates the chemical potential of the factor that defines the threshold of binding. In contrast with the widely used information-theoretic weight matrix method, the new approach correctly describes saturation in the transcription {factor/DNA} binding probability. This results in a significant improvement in the number of expected false positives, particularly in the ubiquitous case of low-specificity factors. In the strong binding limit, the algorithm is related to the "support vector machine" approach to pattern recognition. The new method is used to identify likely genomic binding sites for the E. coli transcription factors collected in the {DPInteract} database. In addition, for {CRP} (a global regulatory factor), the likely regulatory modality (i.e., repressor or activator) of predicted binding sites is determined.},

A final chapter looks at other models and applications, such as wave propagation and multiparticle fluids. With a pedagogic approach, the volume focuses on the use of cellular automata in the framework of equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics. It also emphasises application-oriented problems such as fluid dynamics and pattern formation. The book contains many examples and problems. A glossary and a detailed bibliography are also included.

    abstract = {Some ideas from quantum theory are just beginning to percolate back to
classical probability theory. For example, there is a widely used and
successful theory of "chemical reaction networks", which describes the
interactions of molecules in a stochastic rather than quantum way. Computer
science and population biology use the same ideas under a different name:
"stochastic Petri nets". But if we look at these theories from the perspective
of quantum theory, they turn out to involve creation and annihilation
operators, coherent states and other well-known ideas - but in a context where
probabilities replace amplitudes. We explain this connection as part of a
detailed analogy between quantum mechanics and stochastic mechanics. We use
this analogy to present new proofs of two major results in the theory of
chemical reaction networks: the deficiency zero theorem and the
{Anderson-Craciun}-Kurtz theorem. We also study the overlap of quantum mechanics
and stochastic mechanics, which involves Hamiltonians that can generate either
unitary or stochastic time evolution. These Hamiltonians are called "Dirichlet
forms", and they arise naturally from electrical circuits made only of
resistors.},

                  technique that has revolutionised the analysis of
                  ecological data, allowing the fitting of complex
                  models in a Bayesian framework. Since 2001, there
                  have been nearly 200 papers using {MCMC} in
                  publications of the Ecological Society of America
                  and the British Ecological Society, including more
                  than 75 in the journal Ecology and 35 in the Journal
                  of Applied Ecology. 2. We have noted that many
                  authors routinely 'thin' their simulations,
                  discarding all but every kth sampled value; of the
                  studies we surveyed with details on {MCMC}
                  implementation, 40\% reported thinning. 3. Thinning
                  is often unnecessary and always inefficient,
                  reducing the precision with which features of the
                  Markov chain are summarised. The inefficiency of
                  thinning {MCMC} output has been known since the
                  early 1990's, long before {MCMC} appeared in
                  ecological publications. 4. We discuss the
                  background and prevalence of thinning, illustrate
                  its consequences, discuss circumstances when it
                  might be regarded as a reasonable option and
                  recommend against routine thinning of chains unless

                Genomic analyses often involve scanning for potential transcription factor ({TF}) binding sites using models of the sequence specificity of {DNA} binding proteins. Many approaches have been developed to model and learn a protein's {DNA}-binding specificity, but these methods have not been systematically compared. Here we applied 26 such approaches to in vitro protein binding microarray data for 66 mouse {TFs} belonging to various families. For nine {TFs}, we also scored the resulting motif models on in vivo data, and found that the best in vitro-derived motifs performed similarly to motifs derived from the in vivo data. Our results indicate that simple models based on mononucleotide position weight matrices trained by the best methods perform similarly to more complex models for most {TFs} examined, but fall short in specific cases (<10\% of the {TFs} examined here). In addition, the best-performing motifs typically have relatively low information content, consistent with widespread degeneracy in eukaryotic {TF} sequence preferences.

    abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate that finite linear combinations of compositions of a fixed, univariate function and a set of affine functionals can uniformly approximate any continuous function of n real variables with support in the unit hypercube; only mild conditions are imposed on the univariate function. Our results settle an open question about representability in the class of single hidden layer neural networks. In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity. The paper discusses approximation properties of other possible types of nonlinearities that might be implemented by artificial neural networks.},
